"""This module assists in creating OSCORE servers by proving a wrapper around a
:class:aiocoap.resource.Site. It enforces no access control, but just indicates
to the resources whether a client is authenticated by setting the request's
remote property adaequately.

So far, it needs to be utilized explicitly and manually at server creation. How
this will later be automated will depend on th edirection Site is going -- if
all of :meth:`aiocoap.protocol.Context.render_to_plumbing_request` can be moved
into Site wrappers, this can stay a site wrapper -- otherwise, it may need to
move in there to start render_to_plumbing_request on the unprotected requests
again. (This will also influence a future inner-blockwise implementation).
